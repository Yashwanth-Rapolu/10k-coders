<h4>MALWARE DETECTION USING EXTREME LEARNING MACHINE CLASSIFIER | Python</h4>
<p>
-The goal of implementing malware detection and classification using an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier is to develop a robust and accurate system for identifying and categorizing malicious software among a large volume of digital data.<br>
-This study explores using the ELM classifier for malware detection, demonstrating high accuracy and efficiency in real-time detection, contributing to improved cybersecurity
<h4>DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES FOR SMS SPAM CLASSIFICATION | Python</h4>
<p>
-Deep learning approach for SMS spam classification is to develop a model that can accurately classify text messages as either spam or not spam using deep learning techniques. The goal is to create a robust and efficient system that can effectively filter out unwanted spam messages.<br>
-It involves training a deep learning model on a large dataset of labeled SMS messages to learn patterns and features that distinguish spam from legitimate messages.
